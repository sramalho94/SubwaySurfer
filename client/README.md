## App Description

---

The Subway Surfers Web App is a way for users to write reviews of subway lines. The first page will have a navigation bar that has sign up and log in link. The main page will have the general collection of reviews that the user can browse. Once the user is logged in they will be able to write reviews. There will also be a page that has a list of all subway lines. The user can click on a line and see some information about it and a picture of the line logo.

## Entity Relationships

---

There are three schemes in the App. User, Review and Subway.
The relationship between User and Review is one to many; as one user can post multiple reviews but a review can only be posted by one user. The relationship between Review and Subway is One to Many; as a Review can only be about one Subway line but a Subway line can have many reviews. The relationship between Subway to User is Many to Many; as one Subway line can have many Users.
